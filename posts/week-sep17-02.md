## Prototype / Spike Idea

In about less than two months and a half, our group will be presenting our web application about data visualization.

We would like to create a captivating interactive data visualization tool, that displays growing environmental issues, like C02 emissions and melting ice caps, and helps educate and involve users on these topics.

We’ll start with global climate change in our MVP. We’ll be focusing on greenhouse gases (such as CO2 emissions), in particular its statistics, causes, effects on the environment and the potential solutions/measures to help resolve/slow down these issues.

As a prototype for demonstrating my learning of React JS, I'll build the user interface for the landing page of our web app. It will be minimalistic, simple and focusing on user experience rather than "colorful" designs and displays.

Wish me luck!
