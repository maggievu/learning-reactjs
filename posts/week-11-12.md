## 80% Progress Report

### Retrospective of this week

- This week I was able to create 2 more charts for "Causes & Effects" page. The 1st chart is "Global Carbon Budget" fetched from a local excel file and the 2nd is "Global CO2 emissions" fetched from a live URL with  FTP protocol (different from HTTP protocol).

- I didn't realize it would take me more time than I expected since FTP uses a different fetching protocol than HTTP (didn't know about this before hand).

- Anyway, I succeeded nonetheless to fetch data live from [NASA URL](ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_annmean_mlo.txt).

    ```js
    const ftp = require('ftp');

    let client = new ftp();
    client.on('ready', () => {
        client.get('products/trends/co2/co2_annmean_mlo.txt', (error, stream) => {
            if (error) throw error;

            stream.once('close', () => {
                client.end();
            });

            let content = "";
            stream.on('data', (chunk) => {
                content += chunk;
            });
            stream.on('end', () => {
                dataArray3 = content.split('\n');
                for (let line = 57; line < dataArray3.length-1; line++) {
                    dataArray4.push({
                        "x": dataArray3[line].trim().split("   ")[0],
                        "y": dataArray3[line].trim().split("   ")[1]
                    });
                }
                fs.writeFile('../client/src/components/causes/co2Chart/dataSource/dataset.json', JSON.stringify(dataArray4), 'utf8', (error) => {
                    if (error) throw error;
                });
            });
        });
    });

    client.connect({
        host: "aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov"
    });    
    ```

- As for "Global Carbon Budget", since I wasn't able to find any available and easy-to-fetch-from API, I decided to use the local excel file that I found a while back. Along with that, I used ```excel-to-json``` npm package to convert the data to a JSON format file.

    ```js
    const excelToJson = require('convert-excel-to-json');
    let sourcePath = '../client/src/components/causes/carbonChart/dataSource';

    // Fossil Fuel - column B
    dataArray2.push(excelToJson({
        sourceFile: sourcePath + '/carbon.xlsx',
        sheets: [{
            name: 'Global Carbon Budget',
            range: 'A42:F78',
            columnToKey: {
                A: 'x',
                B: 'y'
            }
        }]
    }));

    // Atmospheric Growth - column D
    dataArray2.push(excelToJson({
        sourceFile: sourcePath + '/carbon.xlsx',
        sheets: [{
            name: 'Global Carbon Budget',
            range: 'A42:F78',
            columnToKey: {
                A: 'x',
                D: 'y'
            }
        }]
    }));

    // Land-use Change Emissions - column C
    dataArray2.push(excelToJson({
        sourceFile: sourcePath + '/carbon.xlsx',
        sheets: [{
            name: 'Global Carbon Budget',
            range: 'A42:F78',
            columnToKey: {
                A: 'x',
                C: 'y'
            }
        }]
    }));

    // Land Sink - column E
    dataArray2.push(excelToJson({
        sourceFile: sourcePath + '/carbon.xlsx',
        sheets: [{
            name: 'Global Carbon Budget',
            range: 'A42:F78',
            columnToKey: {
                A: 'x',
                E: 'y'
            }
        }]
    }));

    // Ocean Sink - column F
    dataArray2.push(excelToJson({
        sourceFile: sourcePath + '/carbon.xlsx',
        sheets: [{
            name: 'Global Carbon Budget',
            range: 'A42:F78',
            columnToKey: {
                A: 'x',
                F: 'y'
            }
        }]
    }));

    fs.writeFile(sourcePath + '/dataset.json', JSON.stringify(dataArray2), 'utf8', (error) => {
        if (error) throw error;
    });
    ```

- And now both of my Fusioncharts have the properly-structured-formatted data to render on screen. Another thing I did was create the "About" page and 4 "Articles" pages. My "About" page simply uses the reusable "Member" component and pass down different data for different members. One missing piece of data is our pictures ```props.memberImg``` but that ca be added later.

    ```js
    // "Member" component

    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    class Member extends Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <section className='about-member'>
                    <img src={this.props.memberImg} alt={this.props.memberName + "'s photo"} />
                    <h3>{this.props.memberName}</h3>
                    <p>{this.props.memberRole}</p>
                    <p>{this.props.memberDesc}</p>
                </section>
            );
        }
    }

    export default Member;
    ```

    ```js
    // "About" component

    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import Member from './Member';

    class About extends Component {
        render() {
            return (

            );
        }
    }

    export default About;
